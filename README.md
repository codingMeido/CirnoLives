# CirnoLives
a general update on my personal situation to friends and such who i am otherwise unable to communicate with via discord etc.

Soooo.... currently homeless XD unfortunatly due to an odd misunderstanding also lost my phone (hopefully temporarily since ive got like a fuckton of sonic and electronics related research on it as well as copies of minuteman V3.14 and YOR units.) no pc either lol, will try to recover cell number, currently 7194826531 unaccessible as well as email accounts.

Overall though, a bit of a rough situation, but tbh i'm enjoying it, ain't got shit to worry about and managed to figure out a lot of people were just using me lol

Not sure which direction to head next, but first step is getting a phone, valid ID and a new SS card, assuming the worst ofc lol, then a job, annnd hopefully getting back on my feet sooner or later. With any luck, without losing all the research i've been doing over the past half a year lol.

Cirno spins and the world keeps hatin lol
XD
